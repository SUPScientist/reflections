How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me automatically!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Go back to old versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Know that you are ready to submit a change, know the size of the change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files could be codependent in a larger project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log tells you what commits were made, their time, user ID, and a description
    git diff commitID_older commitID_newer tells you the diffs btwn those commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As long as you committed something that you know worked, you can go back to that version!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything! But especially larger team projects and things that I'll likely
    work on for a while.
